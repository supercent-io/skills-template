# codebase-search

> Search and navigate large codebases efficiently. Use when finding specific code patterns, tracing function calls, understanding code structure, or ...

## When to use this skill
• Finding specific functions or classes
• Tracing function calls and dependencies
• Understanding code structure and architecture
• Finding usage examples
• Identifying code patterns
• Locating bugs or issues
• Code archaeology (understanding legacy code)
• Impact analysis before changes

## Instructions
▶ S1: Understand what you're looking for
**Feature implementation**:
• Where is feature X implemented?
• How does feature Y work?
• What files are involved in feature Z?
**Bug location**:
• Where is this error coming from?
• What code handles this case?
• Where is this data being modified?
**API usage**:
• How is this API used?
• Where is this function called?
• What are examples of using this?
**Configuration**:
• Where are settings defined?
• How is this configured?
• What are the config options?
▶ S2: Choose search strategy
**Semantic search** (for conceptual questions):
**Grep** (for exact text/patterns):
**Glob** (for file discovery):
▶ S3: Search workflow
**1. Start broad, then narrow**:
**2. Use directory targeting**:
**3. Combine searches**:
▶ S4: Common search patterns
**Find function definition**:
**Find class definition**:
**Find class/function usage**:
**Find imports/requires**:
**Find configuration**:
**Find TODO/FIXME**:
**Find error handling**:
▶ S5: Advanced techniques
**Trace data flow**:
**Find all callsites of a function**:
**Understand a feature end-to-end**:
**Find related files**:
**Impact analysis**:
▶ S6: Search optimization
**Use appropriate context**:
**Case sensitivity**:
**File type filtering**:
**Regex patterns**:

## Best practices
1. Start with semantic search
2. Use grep for precision
3. Combine multiple searches
4. Read surrounding context
5. Check file history
