N:bmad-orchestrator
D:Orchestrates BMAD Method workflows (Analysis → Planning → Solutioning → Implementation). Detects project state, routes to the right phase command, and uses plannotator as a phase gate review tool to approve deliverables before phase transitions.
G:bmad orchestrator workflow planning phase-gate plannotator review implementation

U[4]:
  Initialize BMAD workflow for a new or existing project
  Check current phase status and get recommended next action
  Review phase documents with plannotator before advancing to next phase
  Resume interrupted workflows and track progress across all phases

S[6]{n,action,details}:
  1,Detect,Check bmad/config.yaml — if missing offer /workflow-init to bootstrap
  2,Init,Run /workflow-init → collect project name/type/level(0-4) → create bmad/config.yaml + docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml
  3,Status,Run /workflow-status → parse YAML → display phase progress with ✓/⚠/→ symbols + recommended next command
  4,Route,Map project level + completed workflows → recommend /product-brief /prd /tech-spec /architecture /sprint-planning /dev-story
  5,Gate,After phase doc created → bash scripts/phase-gate-review.sh <doc> → plannotator opens → Approve or Request Changes
  6,Advance,On approval → update workflow_status YAML with file path + plannotator_review:approved → proceed to next phase

R[5]:
  Always check project level (0-4) before recommending workflows — level determines required vs optional phases
  Run phase gate review before EVERY phase transition — plannotator approval is the quality gate
  When plannotator returns changes-requested — revise the document and re-submit before advancing
  Keep docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml updated with output file paths and plannotator_review fields
  Levels 0-1 skip Phase 3 (Architecture); Levels 2+ require Architecture before Implementation
