G:agent-evaluation evals AI-agents benchmarks graders testing quality-assurance
U[7]:
  Designing eval systems for AI agents
  Building benchmarks for coding/conversational/research agents
  Creating graders (code-based, model-based, human)
  Implementing production monitoring
  Setting up CI/CD with automated evals
  Debugging agent performance
  Measuring agent improvement
S[8]{n,action}:
  0,Start early with 20-50 representative tasks
  1,Convert existing manual tests to eval tasks
  2,Ensure clarity + add reference solutions
  3,Balance positive/negative/edge cases
  4,Isolate eval environments (Docker)
  5,Focus on outcomes not paths
  6,Always read transcripts for debugging
  7,Monitor eval saturation
  8,Long-term maintenance + team contribution
T[3]{type,use,notes}:
  Code-based,Coding agents,Fast objective reproducible
  Model-based,Conversational,Flexible needs calibration
  Human,Final validation,Accurate but expensive
A[4]{agent,benchmarks,metrics}:
  Coding,SWE-bench Terminal-Bench,tests lint build diff
  Conversational,τ2-Bench,resolution empathy turns
  Research,Custom,grounding coverage sources
  Computer-Use,WebArena OSWorld,UI DB file state
R[6]:
  Use code-based graders when possible
  Focus on outcomes not intermediate steps
  Read transcripts for debugging insights
  Balance pos/neg/edge cases 50/30/20
  Monitor saturation add harder tasks
  Integrate evals in CI/CD pipeline
X[2]{problem,solution}:
  100% scores,Add harder tasks check saturation
  Prod failures,Add production cases to eval suite
