# Code Review

## When to use this skill
- Reviewing pull requests
- Checking code quality
- Providing feedback on implementations
- Identifying potential bugs
- Suggesting improvements
- Security audits
- Performance analysis

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the context

**Read the PR description**:
- What is the goal of this change?
- Which issues does it address?
- Are there any special considerations?

**Check the scope**:
- How many files changed?
- What type of changes? (feature, bugfix, refactor)
- Are tests included?

### Step 2: High-level review

**Architecture and design**:
- Does the approach make sense?
- Is it consistent with existing patterns?
- Are there simpler alternatives?
- Is the code in the right place?

**Code organization**:
- Clear separation of concerns?
- Appropriate abstraction levels?
- Logical file/folder structure?

### Step 3: Detailed code review

**Naming**:
- [ ] Variables: descriptive, meaningful names
- [ ] Functions: verb-based, clear purpose
- [ ] Classes: noun-based, single responsibility
- [ ] Constants: UPPER_CASE for true constants
- [ ] Avoid abbreviations unless widely known

**Functions**:
- [ ] Single responsibility
- [ ] Reasonable length (< 50 lines ideally)
- [ ] Clear inputs and outputs
- [ ] Minimal side effects
- [ ] Proper error handling

**Classes and objects**:
- [ ] Single responsibility principle
- [ ] Open/closed principle
- [ ] Liskov substitution principle
- [ ] Interface segregation
- [ ] Dependency inversion

**Error handling**:
- [ ] All errors caught and handled
- [ ] Meaningful error messages
- [ ] Proper logging
- [ ] No silent failures
- [ ] User-friendly errors for UI

**Code quality**:
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY)
- [ ] No dead code
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No magic numbers
- [ ] Consistent formatting

### Step 4: Security review

**Input validation**:
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] Type checking
- [ ] Range checking
- [ ] Format validation

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- [ ] Proper authentication checks
- [ ] Authorization for sensitive operations
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Password handling (hashing, salting)

**Data protection**:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] CSRF protection

**Dependencies**:
- [ ] No vulnerable packages
- [ ] Dependencies up-to-date
- [ ] Minimal dependency usage

### Step 5: Performance review

**Algorithms**:
- [ ] Appropriate algorithm choice
- [ ] Reasonable time complexity
- [ ] Reasonable space complexity
- [ ] No unnecessary loops

**Database**:
- [ ] Efficient queries
- [ ] Proper indexing
- [ ] N+1 query prevention
- [ ] Connection pooling

**Caching**:
- [ ] Appropriate caching strategy
- [ ] Cache invalidation handled
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable

**Resource management**:
- [ ] Files properly closed
- [ ] Connections released
- [ ] Memory leaks prevented

### Step 6: Testing review

**Test coverage**:
- [ ] Unit tests for new code
- [ ] Integration tests if needed
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error cases tested

**Test quality**:
- [ ] Tests are readable
- [ ] Tests are maintainable
- [ ] Tests are deterministic
- [ ] No test interdependencies
- [ ] Proper test data setup/teardown

**Test naming**:
```python
# Good
def test_user_creation_with_valid_data_succeeds():
    pass

# Bad
def test1():
    pass
```

### Step 7: Documentation review

**Code comments**:
- [ ] Complex logic explained
- [ ] No obvious comments
- [ ] TODOs have tickets
- [ ] Comments are accurate

**Function documentation**:
```python
def calculate_total(items: List[Item], tax_rate: float) -> Decimal:
    """
    Calculate the total price including tax.

    Args:
        items: List of items to calculate total for
        tax_rate: Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.1 for 10%)

    Returns:
        Total price including tax

    Raises:
        ValueError: If tax_rate is negative
    """
    pass
```

**README/docs**:
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] API docs updated
- [ ] Migration guide if breaking changes

### Step 8: Provide feedback

**Be constructive**:
```
✅ Good:
"Consider extracting this logic into a separate function for better
testability and reusability:

def validate_email(email: str) -> bool:
    return '@' in email and '.' in email.split('@')[1]

This would make it easier to test and reuse across the codebase."

❌ Bad:
"This is wrong. Rewrite it."
```

**Be specific**:
```
✅ Good:
"On line 45, this query could cause N+1 problem. Consider using
.select_related('author') to fetch related objects in a single query."

❌ Bad:
"Performance issues here."
```

**Prioritize issues**:
- 🔴 Critical: Security, data loss, major bugs
- 🟡 Important: Performance, maintainability
- 🟢 Nice-to-have: Style, minor improvements

**Acknowledge good work**:
```
"Nice use of the strategy pattern here! This makes it easy to add
new payment methods in the future."
```

## Common issues

### Anti-patterns

**God class**:
```python
# Bad: One class doing everything
class UserManager:
    def create_user(self): pass
    def send_email(self): pass
    def process_payment(self): pass
    def generate_report(self): pass
```

**Magic numbers**:
```python
# Bad
if user.age > 18:
    pass

# Good
MINIMUM_AGE = 18
if user.age > MINIMUM_AGE:
    pass
```

**Deep nesting**:
```python
# Bad
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        if condition3:
            if condition4:
                # deeply nested code

# Good (early returns)
if not condition1:
    return
if not condition2:
    return
if not condition3:
    return
if not condition4:
    return
# flat code
```

### Security vulnerabilities

**SQL Injection**:
```python
# Bad
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# Good
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

**XSS**:
```javascript
// Bad
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// Good
element.textContent = userInput;
```

**Hardcoded secrets**:
```python
# Bad
API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef"

# Good
API_KEY = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
```

## Best practices

1. **Review promptly**: Don't make authors wait
2. **Be respectful**: Focus on code, not the person
3. **Explain why**: Don't just say what's wrong
4. **Suggest alternatives**: Show better approaches
5. **Use examples**: Code examples clarify feedback
6. **Pick your battles**: Focus on important issues
7. **Acknowledge good work**: Positive feedback matters
8. **Review your own code first**: Catch obvious issues
9. **Use automated tools**: Let tools catch style issues
10. **Be consistent**: Apply same standards to all code

## Tools to use

**Linters**:
- Python: pylint, flake8, black
- JavaScript: eslint, prettier
- Go: golint, gofmt
- Rust: clippy, rustfmt

**Security**:
- Bandit (Python)
- npm audit (Node.js)
- OWASP Dependency-Check
