## What's New in v2026-03-09

| Change | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **6 New Skills Added** | `frontend-design-system`, `image-generation-mcp`, `marketing-skills-collection`, `pptx-presentation-builder`, `remotion-video-production`, `vercel-react-best-practices` — total 71 → **77 skills** |
| **jeo v1.2.1: Gemini/Antigravity repeated plannotator call fix** | `plannotator-plan-loop.sh` now writes `plan_approved` + `phase` to `jeo-state.json` on approval. SKILL.md PLAN block now has a GUARD that reads `jeo-state.json` and skips plannotator if already approved in a previous turn. Prevents infinite re-invocation in hook-based environments. |
| **jeo v1.2.1: Claude Code now requires team mode** | In Claude Code, `jeo` no longer falls back to single-agent execution. EXECUTE must use `/omc:team`. |
| **jeo v1.2.1: plannotator Claude Code fix (P0)** | `plannotator` is hook-only in Claude Code. Removed non-existent `submit_plan` MCP tool call; replaced with correct `EnterPlanMode` → write plan → `ExitPlanMode` hook flow. `bmad-orchestrator/SKILL.md` updated with platform-specific clarifications. |
| **jeo v1.2.1: plannotator auto-install before PLAN** | `jeo` now auto-runs `bash scripts/ensure-plannotator.sh` when `plannotator` is missing. Dynamic script path discovery block added to PLAN pre-flight. |
| **ralphmode v0.2.0: Mid-Execution Approval Checkpoints** | Added Step 6 with platform-specific dangerous operation blocking. Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook (exit 2 block) + Gemini CLI `BeforeTool` hook (non-zero exit block) + Codex CLI `approval_policy="unless-allow-listed"` + OpenCode prompt contract. Tier 1/2/3 classification table included. |
| **jeo v1.2.1: Codex config.toml stray quote fix** | `setup-codex.sh` guards the legacy JEO strip regex — only runs when no `developer_instructions = """` block exists, preventing the closing `"""` from being consumed on re-runs. |
| **jeo v1.2.1: Gemini CLI plannotator feedback wait fix** | AfterAgent hooks now include `timeout: 1800` for plannotator. Old-format hooks without `matcher`/`hooks` wrapper are auto-migrated. |
| **jeo v1.2.1: Claude Code hooks format fix** | Fixed `UserPromptSubmit` hooks to use new matcher format (`{"matcher": "*", "hooks": [...]}`). `setup-claude.sh` now auto-migrates old-format entries on re-run. |
| **bmad-orchestrator: English localization** | Korean sections translated to English for consistency across all skill files. |

## Featured Tools

These tools have full documentation in `docs/` and dedicated skills in `.agent-skills/`.

### plannotator — Interactive Plan & Diff Review
> **Purpose**: Visual plan review and feedback loop before execution | **Platforms**: Claude · Codex · Gemini · OpenCode | **Status**: v0.9.0
> Keyword: `plan` (alias: `planno`) | [Docs](docs/plannotator/README.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/backnotprop/plannotator)

Visual browser UI for annotating AI agent plans before coding. Works with **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, **Gemini CLI**, and **Codex CLI**. Approve plans or send structured feedback in one click.

Validated in-session with Playwright: Approve + feedback loops confirmed across all four platforms. See `docs/plannotator/README.md` for the verified python3 stdin pattern (avoid raw `echo`/heredoc for plan submission).

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh --all   # Install + configure all AI tools at once
```

Path resolution behavior for skill loading:
- Absolute skill paths are used directly (e.g., `/Users/me/.agent-skills/plannotator`)
- Relative skill paths are resolved: configured skills directory → global `~/.agent-skills`

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Plan Review | Opens browser UI when agent exits plan mode — annotate, approve, or send feedback |
| Diff Review | `/plannotator-review` for inline line annotations on git diffs |
| **Obsidian Integration** | Auto-save approved plans to Obsidian vault with YAML frontmatter, tags, and backlinks |
| Bear Notes | Alternative auto-save to Bear Notes (macOS) |
| Share | Share plan review sessions with teammates via link |

#### Obsidian Setup (3 steps)
1. Install Obsidian → https://obsidian.md/download
2. Create/open a vault in Obsidian
3. In plannotator UI: Settings (⚙️) → Saving → Enable "Obsidian Integration" → Select vault

> **Note**: Configure settings in the **system browser** that plannotator auto-opens. Settings configured in automated/Playwright browser sessions are isolated and will not persist. See [Pattern 9: Obsidian Integration Setup](.agent-skills/plannotator/SKILL.md#pattern-9-obsidian-integration-setup) for detailed instructions and folder organization.

#### Obsidian Folder Organization
Plans can be organized into subfolders within the vault:
```
vault/plannotator/
├── approved/    ← approved plans
├── denied/      ← rejected plans
└── 2026-02/     ← monthly archive
```

#### Bear Quick Check (macOS)
```bash
open "bear://x-callback-url/create?title=Plannotator%20Check&text=Bear%20callback%20OK"
```

#### Known Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Browser opens twice | Duplicate `open` call in `plannotator-launch.sh` | Remove `open` from port-detection loop in hook script — plannotator self-opens browser |
| Feedback not received (Codex/Gemini/OpenCode) | Running with `&` background — agent doesn't wait for result | Run blocking (no `&`), then read `/tmp/plannotator_feedback.txt` |
| Codex startup failure (`invalid type: map, expected a string`) | `developer_instructions` declared as table (`[developer_instructions]`) in `~/.codex/config.toml` | Re-run `bash .agent-skills/jeo/scripts/setup-codex.sh` and verify `developer_instructions = "..."` top-level string format |

### vibe-kanban — AI Agent Kanban Board
> **Purpose**: Visual progress tracking for parallel agents | **Platforms**: All | **Status**: stable
> Keyword: `kanbanview` | [Docs](docs/vibe-kanban/README.md) | [GitHub](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban)

Visual Kanban board (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done) with parallel AI agents (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini) isolated per card via git worktrees. Auto-creates PRs on completion.

Codex integration is supported via `pluggable` MCP/tooling setup (see `docs/vibe-kanban/README.md`).

```bash
npx vibe-kanban          # Launch board at http://localhost:3000
```

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Parallel agents | Multiple agents run concurrently on different cards without file conflicts |
| Git worktree isolation | Each card gets its own `vk/<hash>-<slug>` branch and worktree |
| MCP support | Agents control the board programmatically via `vk_*` tools |
| Docker deploy | `docker run -p 3000:3000 vibekanban/vibe-kanban` for remote teams |

---

### ralph — Ouroboros Specification-First AI Development
> **Purpose**: Clarify requirements before coding → persistent loop until verification passes | **Platforms**: Claude · Gemini · Codex · OpenCode | **Status**: stable v3.0.0
> Keyword: `ralph`, `ooo` | [GitHub](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros)

> *Stop prompting. Start specifying. The boulder never stops.*

Ouroboros-based specification-first workflow. Expose hidden assumptions via Socratic interview, crystallize into an immutable spec → Double Diamond execution → 3-stage verification → evolutionary loop until ontology converges.

```bash
# Clarify requirements
ooo interview "I want to build a task management CLI"
ooo seed                     # Generate YAML spec (Ambiguity ≤ 0.2 gate)
ooo run                      # Execute via Double Diamond
ooo evaluate <session_id>    # 3-stage verification

# Persistent loop until verification passes
ooo ralph "fix all failing tests"
```

| Command | Role |
|---------|------|
| `ooo interview` | Socratic questioning → Ambiguity ≤ 0.2 |
| `ooo seed` | Crystallize YAML spec |
| `ooo run` | Double Diamond execution |
| `ooo evaluate` | Mechanical → Semantic → Consensus 3-stage verification |
| `ooo evolve` | Evolutionary loop (Similarity ≥ 0.95 convergence) |
| `ooo ralph` | Persistent loop until verification passes |
| `ooo unstuck` | When blocked — 5-persona lateral thinking |

Codex setup:

```bash
bash <your-agent-skills>/ralph/scripts/setup-codex-hook.sh
```

---

## TOON Format Injection

> **Purpose**: Auto-inject skill context into every prompt | **Platforms**: Claude Code · Codex CLI · Gemini CLI | **Status**: stable v1.0.0

TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) compresses the skill catalog and auto-injects it into every AI tool prompt. 40-50% token savings vs JSON/Markdown. Designed and implemented by a 6-person ultrateam (QA · LLM Expert · Skill Expert · ClaudeCode · Codex · Gemini-CLI).

### Two-Tier Architecture

- **Tier 1 (always injected)**: Skill catalog index (~875-3,500 tokens) — skill names + descriptions + tags injected every prompt
- **Tier 2 (on-demand)**: Individual SKILL.toon full content (~292 tokens/skill, max 3) — auto-loaded on skill name/tag detection

> Injecting all 77 skills simultaneously (~22,400 tokens) is prohibited. Tier 1 + on-demand max 3 keeps context cost below 5%.

### Platform Implementations

| Platform | File | Mechanism | Performance |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/hooks/toon-inject.mjs` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook — Node.js, 3-tier keyword matching, symlink traversal | 26-37ms |
| **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/hooks/toon-skill-inject.sh` | `includeDirectories` session-start load + `AfterAgent` refresh hook | ~0.1s |
| **Codex CLI** | `~/.codex/skills-toon-catalog.toon` | Static catalog + `notify-dispatch.py` + 2-turn sidecar pattern | 0ms (static) |

> **Why Node.js**: `~/.claude/skills/` is a symlink to `~/.agents/skills/`. Python `Path.rglob()` does not follow symlinks and returns 0 results. Node.js `readdirSync` traverses transparently.

### TOON Format Basics

```
N:skill-name  D:description  G:tag1 tag2 tag3
U[n]: use cases · S[n]{n,action,details}: steps · R[n]: rules · E[n]{desc,in,out}: examples
```

**v2026-03-06 (latest)**:
- **TOON Format Cross-Platform Hook Integration**: Designed and implemented by a 6-person ultrateam (QA · LLM Expert · Skill Expert · ClaudeCode · Codex · Gemini-CLI). Claude Code: `~/.claude/hooks/toon-inject.mjs` Node.js hook (symlink traversal, 3-tier keyword matching, 26-37ms). Gemini CLI: `~/.gemini/hooks/toon-skill-inject.sh` + `includeDirectories` + `AfterAgent` hook. Codex CLI: static catalog (`skills-toon-catalog.toon`, 62 skills) + `notify-dispatch.py` + 2-turn sidecar pattern
- **bmad-orchestrator SKILL.md TOON Integration section**: Full two-tier architecture documentation (Tier 1 catalog ~875-3,500 tokens always injected / Tier 2 SKILL.toon on-demand max 3)
- **71 SKILL.toon full validation**: All skills verified and corrected for TOON format compliance

**v2026-03-06 (bug fixes)**:
- **jeo + bmad-orchestrator comprehensive fixes**: Schema alignment, graceful degradation, session-isolated paths
  - Removed zombie `worktrees` field from jeo state schema; added `retry_count`, `last_error`, `checkpoint` error recovery fields
  - Fixed `TEAM_AVAILABLE_BOOL` export for python3 subshell inheritance
  - Session-isolated plannotator feedback path via `hashlib.md5`
  - Replaced `exit 1` with graceful skip → CLEANUP on agentation failure
  - bmad-orchestrator v1.0.0 → v1.1.0; removed unrelated TOON section (~232 lines)
  - `phase-gate-review.sh`: multi-tier `find_workflow_name()` for hyphenated workflow names
  - `check-status.sh`: fixed nested while-loop stdin consumption via python3 subprocess

**v2026-03-05**:
- **jeo: state file guard bug fix (P0)**: Fixed bug where AfterAgent hook incorrectly ran plannotator when `jeo-state.json` was missing
- **jeo: agent execution protocol added (P1)**: Inserted `## 0. Agent Execution Protocol` section in `SKILL.md`. STEP 0–4 imperative pseudocode
- **skills-lock.json: dependency spec added (P1)**: Registered `plannotator` + `agentation` as required_by jeo
- **agentation v1.1.0 installation improvements**: Claude Code Official Skill + Universal `npx add-mcp` + Local-first architecture documentation

**v2026-03-04**:
- **jeo annotate integration (v2)**: VERIFY_UI keyword `agentui` → `annotate`. Phase guard resolves plannotator-agentation hook conflicts. Pre-flight 3-step check, RE-SNAPSHOT verification
- **ralph v3.0.0**: Full rewrite based on [Q00/ouroboros](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros). Interview→Seed→Execute→Evaluate→Evolve, 9 agents, Ambiguity ≤ 0.2 gate, Similarity ≥ 0.95 convergence
- **setup-all-skills-prompt clean reinstall**: Auto-remove existing directories before recreating

**v2026-03-03 (update)**:
- **bmad-gds**: New skill — BMAD Game Development Studio. 5-stage pipeline, 6 specialist agents (Unity/Unreal/Godot)
- **bmad-idea**: New skill — BMAD Creative Intelligence Suite. 5 workflows, 5 named agents
- **ai-tool-compliance P1 expansion**: Added `--include-p1` option, `p1_maturity_score` output, CI toggle

**v2026-03-03**:
- **ai-tool-compliance**: New skill — Automated P0/P1 compliance validation. 4-domain binary scoring (security 40/permissions 25/cost 20/logging 15), GitHub Actions gate, history tracking
