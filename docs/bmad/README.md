## What is BMAD?

BMAD (Business-Method-Agile-Development) is a phase-based workflow that brings discipline to AI-assisted development. Instead of jumping straight to code, BMAD guides you through structured phases so nothing is missed.

```
Phase 1: Analysis       → Understand the problem space
Phase 2: Planning       → Define requirements & tech specs  
Phase 3: Solutioning    → Design the architecture
Phase 4: Implementation → Build, test, ship
```

## Quick Start (3 Commands)

Deploy target: use GitHub Releases for stable rollout tracking, then run the commands below.

**Step 1: Install the skill**

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/supercent-io/skills-template --skill bmad-orchestrator
```

**Step 2: Activate in Claude Code**

```text
bmad 스킬을 설정하고 사용해줘. 기억해.
```

**Step 3: Initialize your project**

```text
/workflow-init
```

That's it. BMAD will ask you about your project, pick the right level, and guide you through the appropriate phases.
