```text
# 1. Initialize BMAD
/workflow-init
# → Project: AuthFix, Level: 0, Type: web-app

# 2. Check current status
/workflow-status
# → Phase 2: Planning [CURRENT] — Tech Spec required

# 3. Create tech spec for the fix
/tech-spec
# → Claude interviews you: What's the bug? What's the expected behavior?
# → Output: docs/tech-spec-authfix-2026-02-20.md

# 4. Create the single story
/create-story
# → Output: docs/stories/story-E001-S001.md

# 5. Implement it
/dev-story
# → Claude reads the story and implements the fix

# 6. Done ✓
```

**Total time:** 30–90 minutes  
**Documents created:** 1 tech spec, 1 story

#    - JWT access + refresh tokens
#    - OAuth (Google, GitHub)
#    - Rate limiting
#    - Account lockout

/create-ux-design
# → User flows for login, registration, password reset

# Phase 3: Solutioning
/architecture
# → System design:
#    - Token storage strategy
#    - Database schema (users, sessions, oauth_providers)
#    - API contract
#    - Security considerations

# Phase 4: Implementation
/sprint-planning
# → Sprint 1: Core auth (7 stories)
#    - story-E001-S001: User model & DB schema
#    - story-E001-S002: Registration endpoint
#    - story-E001-S003: Email verification
#    - story-E001-S004: Login endpoint
#    - story-E001-S005: JWT generation & refresh
#    - story-E001-S006: Logout & token revocation
#    - story-E001-S007: Rate limiting middleware
# → Sprint 2: OAuth (4 stories)
#    ...

# Implement sprint 1
/dev-story  # × 7 stories

# Code review
/code-review
# → Review findings, security audit

# Sprint 2
/dev-story  # × 4 stories
```

**Total time:** 1–3 weeks  
**Documents created:** 1 product brief, 1 PRD, 1 UX design, 1 architecture, 11+ stories

## Example 4: Checking Status Mid-Project

```text
# After some work, check where you are
/workflow-status

# Output:
# Project: AuthSystem (api, Level 2)
#
# ✓ Phase 1: Analysis
#   ✓ product-brief (docs/product-brief-authsystem-2026-02-20.md)
#   - research (optional)
#
# ✓ Phase 2: Planning
#   ✓ prd (docs/prd-authsystem-2026-02-20.md)
#   ✓ ux-design (docs/ux-design-authsystem-2026-02-20.md)
#
# ✓ Phase 3: Solutioning
#   ✓ architecture (docs/architecture-authsystem-2026-02-20.md)
#   - gate-check (optional)
#
# → Phase 4: Implementation [CURRENT]
#   ⚠ sprint-planning (required - NOT STARTED)
#
# Recommended next step: /sprint-planning

# Resume work
/sprint-planning
```

## Example 5: Enterprise SaaS Platform (Level 4)

**Scenario:** Build a multi-tenant B2B SaaS with billing, teams, and analytics.

```text
# 1. Initialize

/create-ux-design  # Complete UX for all major flows

# Phase 3: Solutioning
/architecture      # System-wide architecture
                   # → Microservices vs monolith decision
                   # → Database design (per-tenant isolation)
                   # → Infrastructure (Kubernetes, CDN)
                   # → Security model (RBAC, audit logs)
                   # → Payment integration (Stripe)

/solutioning-gate-check  # Validate architecture meets requirements

# Phase 4: Implementation (multiple sprints)
/sprint-planning   # Breaks into 6+ sprints, 40+ stories

# Sprint 1: Foundation
/dev-story  # × 8 stories (core infrastructure, auth, DB)

# Sprint 2: Multi-tenancy
/dev-story  # × 7 stories

# ... continue through all sprints

/code-review       # Required at Level 4
```

## Tips

1. **Use `/workflow-status` frequently** — It always tells you the recommended next step
2. **Don't skip required workflows** — BMAD will warn you if you try to jump ahead
3. **Level up if scope grows** — You can re-run `/workflow-init` if a Level 1 feature becomes Level 2
4. **Parallel work in Phase 4** — Multiple dev stories from different epics can run in parallel
5. **`기억해` is essential** — Always activate with `기억해` to persist across sessions
